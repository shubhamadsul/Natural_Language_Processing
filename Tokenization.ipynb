    "**NLTK :** The Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) is a library in Python that provides tools to work with human language data (text). It is a popular library for working with text data in the field of natural language processing (NLP). The library contains a wide range of tools and resources, including tools for tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, stemming, and lemmatization, as well as tools for parsing and processing treebanks, WordNet, and other corpora. It also includes a collection of text data, including sample data and a number of large corpora, such as the Brown Corpus and the Penn Treebank. The library is widely used by researchers and practitioners working in NLP, and is an essential tool for many NLP tasks."

    "**Tokenization :** Tokenization is the process of breaking a stream of text up into individual words, phrases, symbols, or other meaningful elements, known as tokens. The tokens can then be further processed, such as for the purpose of language modeling, machine translation, or information retrieval. Tokenization is a crucial preprocessing step in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, as it allows the relevant information in a text to be extracted and processed effectively. There are many different approaches to tokenization, depending on the desired characteristics of the tokens and the specific requirements of the task at hand. Some common approaches include using whitespace as a delimiter, using regular expressions to identify specific patterns, or using a predefined vocabulary of known tokens"
